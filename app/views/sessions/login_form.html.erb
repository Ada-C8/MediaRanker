<h4>A note about logging in</h4>
 <p>
   There is no password field. In fact, there is no indication whatsoever
   that you are who you say you are. There's nothing special about users -
   username is just another piece of data that the user entered and we have to keep
   track of.

   For now, don't worry about it beyond what you can see here.
