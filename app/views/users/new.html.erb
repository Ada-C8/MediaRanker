  <h3>A note about logging in</h3>
  <p>There is no password field. In fact, there is no indication whatsoever that you are who you say you are. There's nothing special about users - username is just another piece of data that the user entered and we have to keep track of. <Br />We'll learn more about security and authentication in the next couple weeks. For now, don't worry about it beyond what you can see here.</p>
